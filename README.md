ODE Simulation
=============

Customizable static HTML mass-spring simulation.

## Viewing
Check out page at [https://seolteam.github.io/ode-tutorial2/]()

You can control different options, for instance use
[https://http://seolteam.github.io/ode-tutorial2/#?showGraph=false&showStopwatch=true&showMSlider=false]() to hide the graph, show stopwatch, and hide the mass slider. The default options are:
* showKSlider:    true   (The slider used to control the spring constant K is shown by default.)
* showMSlider:    true   (The slider used to control the circle mass m is shown by default.)
* showASlider:    true   (The slider used to control the spring amplitude A is shown by default.)
* showStopwatch:  false  (The stopwatch control is hidden by default.)
* showAnimation:  true   (The spring and draggable mass animation is shown by default.)
* showGraph:      true   (The graph of time and spring position is shown by default.)
